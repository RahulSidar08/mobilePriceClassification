# mobilePriceClassification

With the development of technology, mobile phones are an indispensable part of human life. Factors such as brand, internal memory, wifi, battery power, camera and availability of 4G are now modifying consumersâ€™ decisions on buying mobile phones. But people fail to link those factors with the price of mobile phones; this projet  figure out the problem by using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression & K Nearest Neighbors  to train the mobile phone dataset before making predictions of the price level. 

The  project aims to predict the price category of mobile phones based on various features. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project provides insights into how different specifications influence mobile phone pricing, enabling users to make informed purchasing decisions.
